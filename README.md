# Chrome University

Chrome University is an event hosted by the Chrome team to get you up to speed with everything Chrome as a contributor. 

In Chrome University, you will learn the basic foundations of how Chrome works across numerous tech talks spanning the entire Chrome Browser/Chrome OS team and also network with other Chromies. 

This was designed as a broad introduction to the most important/useful aspects of developing a browser and OS. It is beneficial to long-time Chromies as well as new folks joining the team. It is an opportunity to refresh your knowledge or learn something new.

Here are some of the design patterns we identified.

Here is the agenda for past editions.
